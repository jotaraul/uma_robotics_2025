    "## 5.3 Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. It also includes restricting access to some of an object’s components, ensuring that an object's internal state cannot be altered directly from outside its defining class, but only through a well-defined interface (methods). This approach helps safeguard against unauthorized access and modifications, promoting greater security and data integrity within software applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Use Encapsulation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- To control how data is accessed or modified: By providing methods (getters and setters) to access or change attribute values, you can validate data before it's assigned to an attribute, ensuring that your objects always remain in a valid state.\n",
    "- To make the code more maintainable and flexible: Encapsulation allows you to change how an attribute is implemented without affecting the rest of your codebase, as long as the interface (getters and setters) remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getters and Setters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Getters** are methods used to access the value of an attribute without exposing the attribute itself. This allows you to add logic to the process of retrieving the value, such as formatting output or calculating a value on the fly.\n",
    "- **Setters** are methods used to set the value of an attribute. They allow you to validate or modify the data before it's saved, ensuring the object maintains a valid state.\n",
    "\n",
