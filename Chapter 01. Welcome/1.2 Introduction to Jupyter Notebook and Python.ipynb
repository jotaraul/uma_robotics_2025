    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. It also includes restricting access to some of an object’s components, ensuring that an object's internal state cannot be altered directly from outside its defining class, but only through a well-defined interface (methods). This approach helps safeguard against unauthorized access and modifications, promoting greater security and data integrity within software applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Use Encapsulation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- To control how data is accessed or modified: By providing methods (getters and setters) to access or change attribute values, you can validate data before it's assigned to an attribute, ensuring that your objects always remain in a valid state.\n",
    "- To make the code more maintainable and flexible: Encapsulation allows you to change how an attribute is implemented without affecting the rest of your codebase, as long as the interface (getters and setters) remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getters and Setters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Getters** are methods used to access the value of an attribute without exposing the attribute itself. This allows you to add logic to the process of retrieving the value, such as formatting output or calculating a value on the fly.\n",
    "- **Setters** are methods used to set the value of an attribute. They allow you to validate or modify the data before it's saved, ensuring the object maintains a valid state.\n",
    "\n",

    "In this exercise, you will simulate collecting sensor data from a robot navigating an environment. You will use NumPy to generate the data and Matplotlib to visualize it, mimicking a real-world scenario where a robot might be collecting data about its surroundings over time.\n",

    "**Task:**\n",

    "1. Generate a NumPy array of random data that represents the distance sensor readings of a robot over a period of 100 time steps. Take a look at `np.arange()` for that.\n",
    "2. Plot this data using Matplotlib, creating a graph that shows the distance readings over time.\n",
    "3. Customize your plot with a title, axis labels, and any other features you think will make the graph more informative or visually appealing.\n",

    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `np.random.rand(100)` to generate the sensor readings. This function creates an array of 100 random numbers between 0 and 1, which can simulate distance readings in some unit of measurement.\n",
